# using: the "DEBUG" trap, and the "PROMPT_COMMAND" variable.  iterm2_preexec_install
# will override these and if you override one or the other this _will_ break.

# This is known to support bash3, as well as *mostly* support bash2.05b.  It
# has been tested with the default shells on MacOS X 10.4 "Tiger", Ubuntu 5.10
# "Breezy Badger", Ubuntu 6.06 "Dapper Drake", and Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft".

# tmux and screen are not supported; even using the tmux hack to get escape
# codes passed through, ncurses interferes and the cursor isn't in the right
# place at the time it's passed through.

      # the end of this script:
      #   PS1="$(iterm2_prompt_prefix)$PS1($iterm2_prompt_suffix)"
      # and have iterm2_prompt_prefix set a global variable that tells precmd not to
      # output anything and have iterm2_prompt_suffix reset that variable.
      # Unfortunately, command substitutions run in subshells and can't
      # communicate to the outside world.
      # Instead, we have this workaround. We save the original value of PS1 in
      # $ITERM_ORIG_PS1. Then each time this function is run (it's called from

      # set PS1 from a PROMPT_COMMAND that runs just before us. Setting ITERM_ORIG_PS1
      # at the top of the script will overwrite liquidprompt's PS1, whose value would
      # never make it into ITERM_ORIG_PS1. Issue 4532. It's important to check
