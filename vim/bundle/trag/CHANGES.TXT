CHANGES:
0.1
- Initial release

0.2
- Quite a few things have changed and I haven't had the time yet to test 
these changes thorougly. There is a chance that nested patterns thus 
don't work as described (please report).
- Enable search for more than one kinds at once (as comma-separated 
list)
- Enabled <c-e>: Run ex-command on selected lines (e.g. for refactoring 
purposes)
- Enabled <c-s>, <c-v>, <c-t>: Open selected lines in (vertically) split 
windows or tabs.
- Renamed vV kinds to lL (~ let)
- New kind: r/R (right hand side arguemnt of an assignment/let, i.e. 
value)
- New kind: fuzzy (typo-tolerant search)
- INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Renamed "mode" to "kind"
- TRag now has some idea of negation. E.g., "TRag !i,w call" will search 
for the word "call" but ignore matches in comments (if defined for the 
    current filetype)
- Alternative methods to define project files: g:trag_files, 
g:trag_glob, g:trag_project.
- Improved support for ruby, vim
- TRagKeyword, trag#CWord(): Customize keyword rx.
- g:trag_get_files
- [bg]:trag_project_{&filetype}: Name of the filetype-specific project 
files catalog (overrides [bg]:trag_project if defined)
- trag#Edit() will now initally select files with the same "basename 
root" (^\w\+) as the current buffer (the command is thus slightly more 
useful and can be used as an ad-hoc alternative file switcher)
- FIX: Match a line only once
- FIX: Caching of regexps

0.3
- Use vimgrep with set ei=all as default search mode (can be configured 
via g:trag_search_mode); by default trag now is a wrapper around vimgrep 
that does the handling of project-related file-sets and regexp builing 
for you.
- FIX: ruby/f regexp

0.4
- trag_proj* variables were renamed to trag_project*.
- Traggrep: Arguments have changed for conformity with grep commands (an 
implicit .-argument is prepended)
- Make sure tlib is loaded even if it is installed in a different 
rtp-directory.
- Post-process lines (strip whitespace) collected by vimgrep
- tlib#Edit(): for list input, set pick_last_item=0, show_empty=1
- Aliases for some commands: Trag, Traggrep ...

0.5
- Update the qfl when running a command on selected lines
- Enable certain operations for multiple choices
- Java, Ruby: x ... find subclasses (extends/implements)
- Experimental rename command for refactoring (general, java)
- NEW: [bg]:trag_get_files_{&filetype}
- Traggrep: If the second argument (glob pattern) is missing, the 
default file list will be used.

0.6
- trag#viki#Rename()
- Generalized trag#rename#Rename()
- Enabled "trace cursor" functionality (mapped to the <c-insert> key).
- :Traglw
- TRagGitFiles, trag#SetGitFiles(), g:trag_git

0.7
- trag#QuickList(): Accept a dict as optional argument.
- trag#Grep(): rx defaults to '\.{-}'
- trag#Grep(): use :g (instead of search()) for non-vimgrep mode

0.8
- Moved the definition of some variables from plugin/trag.vim to autoload/trag.vim
- :TRagcw! (show :cw even if there are no recognized errors)
- Require tlib 0.37

0.9
- g:trag#use_buffer

version: "0.09"
  - Don't hide the window if all error numbers are -1
  - .gitignore
  - trag#Grep(): trigger QuickFixCmdPre & QuickFixCmdPost events for "trag"
  - trag#LocList() used qfl
