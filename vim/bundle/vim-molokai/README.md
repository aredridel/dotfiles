# Molokai Color Scheme for Vim

Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.

By default, it has a dark gray background based on the version created by Hamish Stuart Macpherson for the E editor. Screenshots are available [here](http://winterdom.com/2008/08/molokaiforvim).

256-Color terminals are also supported, though there are some differences with the Gui version. Only the dark gray background style is supported on terminal vim at this time.

## Installation

Just copy the file on your .vim/colors folder.

If you prefer the scheme to match the original monokai background color, put this in your .vimrc file: 
    let g:molokai_original = 1
